# FILE ORDER
# .zshenv → .zprofile → .zshrc → .zlogin → .zlogout
#
# This is read first and read every time, regardless of the shell being login,
# interactive, or none.
#
# This is the recommended place to set environment variables, though I still
# prefer to set my environment variables in .zprofile
#
# Why would you need it? Because, for example, if you have a script that gets
# called by launchd, it will run under non-interactive non-login shell, so
# neither .zshrc nor .zprofile will get loaded.

#NEEDS: qt5-wayland
# To run a Qt 5 application with the Wayland plugin [3], use -platform wayland
# or QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland environment variable. To force the usage of X11 on
# a Wayland session, use QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb. This might be necessary for some
# proprietary applications that do not use the system's implementation of Qt,
# such as zoom.

#NEEDS: qt5ct
# On some compositors, for example sway, Qt applications running natively might
# have missing functionality. For example, KeepassXC will be unable to minimize
# to tray. This can be solved by installing qt5ct and setting
# QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct before running the application.
